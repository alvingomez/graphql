Resolver
--is a function that is responsible for "FETCHING the data" for a specific field in the schema.
--think of it as a "bridge" between your GraphQL schema and your data sources
  (like databasesm, API's or other services )

--when a client sends a GraphQL query, the resolver is triggered to fetch the requested data.
